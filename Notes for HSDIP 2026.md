# Comments from the open discussion at HSDIP 2025

* We would like HSDIP to go back to more of a classical workshop setting rather than a mini-conference. In particular, that could mean more focus on unfinished work and longer discussions (e.g. 10 Minutes talk + 10 Minutes discussion).
* Presenting previously published work is still fine but shouldn't become the core of HSDIP. In particular not papers that are presented elsewhere at ICAPS (from most to least problematic: main conference, other workshops, DC)
* The number of submissions we had (7) seemed a bit small to us but this might be an effect of approaching it from a mini-conference point of view. Seven submissions is plenty if we spend more time discussing each paper, rather than trying to squeeze 15 presentations into one slot.
* There is splintering of the workshops going on: work that might have been presented at HSDIP now has other more specialized forums to pick from. This might be the normal way for things to go an totally fine but we did not reach a clear conclusion on this.
* In other communities workshop are round tables (i.e., not theater seating but people seeing each other and talking to each other) where people create working groups to work on a problem.
* On a technical level: we should figure out how to structure the HSDIP github repo (use of branches, ownership transfer to new organization team, etc., how to pass notes like this)

* Some concrete suggestions of how to get to a more discussion-heavy workshop:
  * Add specific questions to the call, for example challenges, open problems and open-end questions we want answered
    ("X is the simplest thing in area Y we would like to solve but could not", "what is the complexity of X?")
  * Explicitly approach and encourage people to submit unfinished work. To some degree we want senior researchers to set an example here, to show more junior researchers that it is ok to present something you don't have an answer for. On the other hand, we don't want this to become a place where only old people are talking to each other.
  * Generally, approaching people directly asking them to submit something might help. Especially if we want to change the style of the workshop, making changes to the CFP doesn't necessarily work because many people do not read it beyond the due dates. But we have to be careful to keep the workshop open to newcomers. One suggestion was to make announcements in slack ("This year, we want to try something new at HSDIP: ....").
  * Explicitly ask for challenge proposals as papers/abstracts. Collect the 20 heuristic search problems of the century/year/...
  * Maybe an intermediate set would be an explicit track for unfinished work. In time that track should become the norm but to get people used to it, having it as a separate track might work.
  * Accept failure stories. The results of the discussion in the WEEP workshop in 2024, was that such papers do not necessarily need their own workshop but should be accepted in their respective workshops.
  * Ask people to submit an abstract rather than a paper. (We already had the option of submitting any length of paper but maybe we should make it more explicit that the paper is not central to the participation in the workshop. Instead, the talk and discussion afterwards is the central contribution and the submitted paper/abstract is just our way of selecting which contributions to accept).
