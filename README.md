# General Information

* We aim at having an HSDIP workshop every year at ICAPS.
* There is a permanent group that ensures that HSDIP is run at ICAPS every year, i.e. that there is a team of organizers who submit a proposal.
Current members of that group are Daniel Gnad, Michael Katz, Thorsten Kloessner, and Alvaro Torralba.
To drop out of that group, you need to find a successor.
* There exists a google group for the workshop: hsdip@googlegroups.com


# Timeline

* Submission deadline for ICAPS workshop proposals is typically around December/January.
* With acceptance notification, the organizers usually specify a rough schedule of when to publish the call, have paper submission, notifications, and so on.
* TODO: include a sketch of a usual timeline here; e.g. Workshop date: week X => CRC submission: X-4 => Notification: X-8, ... (these are just some random numbers)
