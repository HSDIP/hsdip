# Deadlines and Dates

Submission deadline: 31 March 2023 (UTC-12 timezone)
Open discussion: 20-27 April 2023
Notification: 5 May 2023
Workshop: 09/10 July 2023


# Topics

Heuristics and search algorithms are the two key components of
heuristic search, one of the main approaches to many variations of
domain-independent planning, including classical planning, temporal
planning, planning under uncertainty and adversarial planning. This
workshop seeks to understand the underlying principles of current
heuristics and search methods, their limitations, ways for overcoming
those limitations, as well as the synergy between heuristics and
search.

Examples of typical topics for submissions to this workshop are:
- automatic derivation of heuristic estimators for domain-independent planning
- formal results showing equivalence or dominance between heuristics
- novel heuristic methods dealing with planning with numeric variables
  and effects, partial observability and non-deterministic action effects
- heuristic estimators for domain-independent planning via procedures or 
  suitably defined encodings of declarative descriptions of planning tasks into 
  Satisfiability or Optimisation
- novel search techniques for domain-independent planning that explicitly aim at 
  exploiting effectively the properties of existing heuristics
- empirical observations of synergies between heuristics and search in 
  domain-independent planning
- challenging domains for existing combinations of heuristics and search 
  algorithms
- applications of machine learning in heuristic search, e.g., learning heuristics, 
  adaptive search strategies, or heuristic selection
- interesting algorithmic optimizations for the calculation of a 
  heuristic or the execution of a search

The HSDIP workshop has always been welcoming of multidisciplinary work, for 
example, drawing inspiration from operations research (like row and column 
generation algorithms), convex optimization (like gradient optimization for 
hybrid planning), constraint programming, or satisfiability.

The workshop is meant to be an open and inclusive forum, and we encourage papers
that report on work in progress or that do not fit the mold of a typical
conference paper. Non-trivial negative results are welcome to the workshop, but
we expect the authors to argue for the significance of the presented results. 


# Submissions

Please format submissions in AAAI style (see instructions in the Author Kit at 
https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit23.zip) and keep them to 
at most 9 pages including references. Authors considering submitting to the 
workshop papers rejected from the main conference, please ensure you do your 
utmost to address the comments given by ICAPS reviewers. Please do not submit 
papers that are already accepted for the main conference to the workshop.

Submissions will be made through OpenReview:

https://openreview.net/group?id=icaps-conference.org/ICAPS/2023/Workshop/HSDIP

The following conditions apply:

 - Submissions will be double blind in general and single blind to the area
   chair.
 - The submitted papers, reviews and discussion between authors and reviewers
   will be public, and all anonymous.
 - Discussions between reviewers and organizers will be private.

Every submission will be reviewed by a member of the organizing committee,
and/or external reviewers selected by the organizing committee, according
to the usual criteria such as relevance to the workshop, significance
of the contribution, and technical quality. There will be a brief discussion 
phase where author and reviewers can interactively engage and discuss the 
submission and the reviews.

Submissions sent to other conferences are allowed. It is the responsibility of
the authors to ensure that those venues allow for papers submitted to be
already published in "informal" ways (e.g. on proceedings or websites without
associated ISSN/ISBN). In particular, we welcome submissions sent to the IJCAI
conference.

At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop in order to
present the paper.
