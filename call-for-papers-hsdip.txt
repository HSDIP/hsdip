Heuristics and Search for Domain-independent Planning (HSDIP 2018)

http://icaps18.icaps-conference.org/hsdip.html

*******************************************************************

Heuristics and search algorithms are the two key components of
heuristic search, one of the main approaches to many variations of
domain-independent planning, including classical planning, temporal
planning, planning under uncertainty and adversarial planning. This
workshop seeks to understand the underlying principles of current
heuristics and search methods, their limitations, ways for overcoming
those limitations, as well as the synergy between heuristics and
search.


Call for Papers

Topics and Objectives

Search guided by heuristics, automatically derived from a 
declarative formulation of action effects, preconditions and 
goals, has been a successful approach to domain-independent 
planning. From the initial success of heuristics based on 
syntactic relaxations and abstractions, the theory and 
practice of developing novel heuristics has become more 
diverse, often borrowing concepts and tools from Optimisation 
and Satisfiability, and more bold, tackling more expressive 
planning languages.

In parallel to the increasing maturity of the methods and tools 
used to derive heuristic methods, important theoretical results 
have brought around a more clear image of how heuristic method 
relate to each other. For instance, it has been shown that classic
frameworks for heuristic search as planning can be encoded 
symbolically and their execution simulated via off-the-shelf 
satisfiability solvers. Groundbreaking theoretical work has shown 
how heuristic methods can be grouped into distinct families, 
depending on whether they can or cannot be shown to dominate or 
be compiled into each other. 

As a result, the formulation of heuristics for domain-independent 
planning is increasingly being less about describing procedures 
that exploit specific features in declarative information, and 
more about describing auxiliary constraints that make apparent 
those features to off-the-shelf solvers that operate over a 
logical or algebraic theory that over-approximate the set of valid 
plans and compute the heuristic estimator. 

Last, but not least, there is a growing realization that the search 
algorithm used can significantly amplify or reduce the utility of 
specific heuristics. Recent work that highlights the pitfalls latent 
in well-known search algorithms, also suggests opportunities to 
exploit synergies between the heuristic calculation and the search 
control.

The workshop on Heuristics and Search for Domain-Independent Planning 
(HSDIP) is the 10th workshop in a series that started with the 
"Heuristics for Domain-Independent Planning" (HDIP) workshops at ICAPS
2007. At ICAPS 2012, the workshop was changed to its current name and 
scope to explicitly encourage work on search for domain-independent 
planning.

Examples of typical topics for submissions to this workshop are:
- automatic derivation of heuristic estimators for domain-independent
  planning
- formal results showing equivalence or dominance between heuristics
- novel heuristic methods dealing with planning with numeric variables 
  and effects, partial observability and non-deterministic action 
  effects
- heuristic estimators for domain-independent planning via procedures 
  or suitably defined encodings of declarative descriptions of planning 
  tasks into Satisfiability or Optimisation
- novel search techniques for domain-independent planning that explicitly 
  aim at exploiting effectively the properties of existing heuristics
- empirical observations of synergies between heuristics and search in 
  domain-independent planning
- challenging domains for existing combinations of heuristics and search 
  algorithms

Submissions

Please format submissions in AAAI style (see instructions in the Author 
Kit at http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit18.zip) and 
keep them to at most 9 pages including references. Authors considering 
submitting to the workshop papers rejected from the main conference, 
please ensure you do your utmost to address the comments given by ICAPS
reviewers. Please do not submit papers that are already accepted for
the main conference to the workshop.

Submissions should be made through EasyChair:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hsdip2018.

Deadlines and Dates

Submission deadline: March 16th, 2018 (UTC-12 timezone)
Notification: April 13th, 2018
Camera Ready: TBD
Workshop: June 25 or 26, 2018

Every submission will be reviewed by two members of the organizing
committee according to the usual criteria such as relevance to the
workshop, significance of the contribution, and technical quality. The
review process will be single-blind: the authors' identity will be
known to the reviewers, but not vice versa.

Submissions sent to other conferences are allowed if this does not
interfere with their submission rules. Submissions under double-blind
review in another conference must be anonymous. In particular,
submissions of papers under revision in IJCAI18 must be anonymous.

The workshop is meant to be an open and inclusive forum, and we
encourage papers that report on work in progress or that do not fit
the mold of a typical conference paper.

At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop in
order to present the paper. Authors must register for the ICAPS main
conference in order to attend the workshop. There will be no separate
workshop-only registration.

In order to encourage the submission of original papers to the
workshops, the ICAPS council has announced an initiative to fast-track
strong workshop papers from one year to the main track of the next
ICAPS. Up to two papers will be recommended by the HSDIP
organizers. The ICAPS 2019 program chairs will have a look at these
papers and the workshop reviews and invite the authors of these papers
to resubmit them to the ICAPS 2019 main track.
