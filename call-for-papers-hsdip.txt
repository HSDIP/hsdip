********************************************************************************

Heuristics and search algorithms are the two key components of heuristic search, 
one of the main approaches to many variations of domain-independent planning, 
including classical planning, temporal planning, planning under uncertainty and 
adversarial planning. This workshop seeks to understand the underlying principles 
of current heuristics and search methods, their limitations, ways for overcoming 
those limitations, as well as the synergy between heuristics and search.

### Topics and Objectives

Search guided by heuristics, automatically derived from a declarative 
formulation of action effects, preconditions and goals, has been a successful 
approach to domain-independent planning. From the initial success of heuristics 
based on syntactic relaxations and abstractions, the theory and practice of 
developing novel heuristics have become more diverse, often borrowing concepts 
and tools from Optimisation and Satisfiability, and bolder, tackling more 
expressive planning languages.

In parallel to the increasing maturity of the methods and tools used to derive 
heuristic methods, important theoretical results have brought around a more 
clear image of how heuristic methods relate to each other. For instance, it has 
been shown that classic frameworks for heuristic search as planning can be 
encoded symbolically and their execution simulated via off-the-shelf 
satisfiability solvers. Groundbreaking theoretical work has shown how heuristic 
methods can be grouped into distinct families, depending on whether they can or 
cannot be shown to dominate or be compiled into each other.

As a result, the formulation of heuristics for domain-independent planning is 
increasingly being less about describing procedures that exploit specific 
features in declarative information, and more about describing auxiliary 
constraints that make apparent those features to off-the-shelf solvers that 
operate over a logical or algebraic theory that over-approximate the set of valid
plans and compute the heuristic estimator.

Last, but not least, there is a growing realization that the search algorithm 
used can significantly amplify or reduce the utility of specific heuristics. 
Recent work that highlights the pitfalls latent in well-known search algorithms, 
also suggests opportunities to exploit synergies between the heuristic 
calculation and the search control.

The workshop on Heuristics and Search for Domain-Independent Planning (HSDIP) is
the 12th workshop in a series that started with the "Heuristics for 
Domain-Independent Planning" (HDIP) workshops at ICAPS 2007. At ICAPS 2012, the 
workshop was changed to its current name and scope to explicitly encourage work 
on search for domain-independent planning.

Examples of typical topics for submissions to this workshop are:
- automatic derivation of heuristic estimators for domain-independent planning
- formal results showing equivalence or dominance between heuristics
- novel heuristic methods dealing with planning with numeric variables
  and effects, partial observability and non-deterministic action effects
- heuristic estimators for domain-independent planning via procedures or 
  suitably defined encodings of declarative descriptions of planning tasks into 
  Satisfiability or Optimisation
- novel search techniques for domain-independent planning that explicitly aim at 
  exploiting effectively the properties of existing heuristics
- empirical observations of synergies between heuristics and search in 
  domain-independent planning
- challenging domains for existing combinations of heuristics and search 
  algorithms

The HSDIP workshop has always been welcoming of multidisciplinary work, for 
example, drawing inspiration from operations research (like row and column 
generation algorithms), convex optimization (like gradient optimization for 
hybrid planning), constraint programming or satisfiability, or applications of 
machine learning in heuristic search (e.g., learning heuristics, adaptive search 
strategies, or heuristic selection).

### Keynote Speaker

The HSDIP workshop is proud to announce that Sylvie Thiébaux will be a keynote
speaker for this year's workshop. Sylvie is a professor of Computer Science at
ANU. In the recent past, she was the director of NICTA’s Canberra Laboratories,
home to 150 researchers and PhD students, and the Associate Dean Research
for the College of Engineering and Computer Science.  She is co-Editor in
Chief of the Artificial Intelligence journal (AIJ), a former ICAPS president,
associate editor of JAIR, and Councilor of the Association for the Advancement
of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI).

### Submissions

Please format submissions in AAAI style (see instructions in the Author Kit at 
https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit20.zip) and keep them to 
at most 9 pages including references. Authors considering submitting to the 
workshop papers rejected from the main conference, please ensure you do your 
utmost to address the comments given by ICAPS reviewers. Please do not submit 
papers that are already accepted for the main conference to the workshop.

Submissions will be made through OpenReview:

https://openreview.net/group?id=icaps-conference.org/ICAPS/2020/Workshop/HSDIP

The following conditions apply:

 - Submissions will be double blind in general and single blind to the area
 chair.
 - The submitted papers, reviews and discussion between authors and reviewers
 will be public, and all anonymous.
 - Discussions between reviewers and organisers will be private.

Every submission will be reviewed by two members of the organizing committee
according to the usual criteria such as relevance to the workshop, significance
of the contribution, and technical quality. There will be a brief 1 week
discussion phase where author and reviewers can interactively engage and discuss
the submission and the reviews.

Submissions sent to other conferences are allowed. It is the responsibility of
the authors to ensure that those venues allow for papers submitted to be
already published in "informal" ways (e.g. on proceedings or websites without
associated ISSN/ISBN). In particular, we welcome submissions sent to the IJCAI
conference and made sure that the workshop discussion phase does not conflict
with the IJCAI rebuttal phase.

The workshop is meant to be an open and inclusive forum, and we encourage papers
that report on work in progress or that do not fit the mold of a typical
conference paper. Non-trivial negative results are welcome to the workshop, but
we expect the authors to argue for the significance of the presented results to
alternative lines of research on the topic of choice.

At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop in order to
present the paper. Authors must register for the ICAPS main conference in order
to attend the workshop. There will be no separate workshop-only registration.
