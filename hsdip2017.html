                                        <p>Heuristics and search algorithms are the two key components of heuristic search, one of the
					  main approaches to many variations of domain-independent planning,
					  including classical planning, temporal planning, planning under
					  uncertainty and adversarial planning. This workshop seeks to
					  understand the underlying principles of current heuristics and search
					  methods, their limitations, ways for overcoming those limitations, as
					  well as the synergy between heuristics and search. HSDIP-17 will be a
					  part of the <a href="http://icaps17.icaps-conference.org/">ICAPS
					    2017</a> conference.</p>

                                        <p>State-space search guided by heuristics, automatically derived from
                                        the problem representation, has been one of the most popular, and
                                        arguably one of the most successful, approaches to domain-independent
                                        planning in the last decade. While there has been significant
                                        developments in the design of planning heuristics, such that there are
                                        now many different kinds of heuristics, and some theories of how they
                                        relate to each other have begun to emerge, there is also a growing
                                        realization that the search algorithm plays an equally important role
                                        in the approach. Recent work has highlighted some of the weaknesses in
                                        well-known search algorithms, but also opportunities to exploit
                                        synergies between the heuristic calculation and the search control to
                                        improve both, while relying on domain-independent, declarative descriptions
                                        of the state space.State-space search guided by heuristics, automatically derived from

					<p>The workshop on Heuristics and Search for Domain-Independent Planning
                    (HSDIP) is the ninth workshop in a series that started with the
                    "Heuristics for Domain-Independent Planning" (HDIP) workshops at ICAPS
                    2007. At ICAPS 2012, the workshop was changed to its current name and
                    scope to explicitly encourage work on search for domain-independent
                    planning.

                                        <h3>Submissions</h3>

                                        <p>Please format submissions in AAAI style (see instructions in the Author
					  Kit at <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit17.zip">http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit17.zip</a>) and
					  keep them to at most 9 pages including references. Authors considering
					  submitting to the workshop papers rejected from the main conference,
					  please ensure you do your utmost to address the comments given by ICAPS
					  reviewers. Please do not submit papers that are already accepted for
					  the main conference to the workshop.</p>

					<p>Submissions should be made through EasyChair:
					  <a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hsdip2017">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hsdip2017</a>.</p>

					<p>Every submission will be reviewed by two members of the organizing
					  committee according to the usual criteria such as relevance to the
					  workshop, significance of the contribution, and technical quality. The
					  review process will be single-blind: the authors' identity will be
					  known to the reviewers, but not vice versa.
					</p>

					<p> Submissions sent to other conferences are allowed if this do not
					  interfere with their submission rules. Submissions under double-blind
					  review in another conference must be anonymous. In particular, <strong>submissions
					  of papers under revision in IJCAI17 must be anonymous</strong> </p>

					<p>The workshop is meant to be an open and inclusive forum, and we
					  encourage papers that report on work in progress or that do not fit
					  the mold of a typical conference paper.</p>

					<p>At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop in
					  order to present the paper. Authors must register for the ICAPS main
					  conference in order to attend the workshop. There will be no separate
					  workshop-only registration.</p>

                      <p>In order to encourage the submission of original papers to the
                    workshops, the ICAPS council has announced an initiative to fast-track
                    strong workshop papers from one year to the main track of the next
                    ICAPS. Up to two papers will be recommended by the HSDIP
                    organizers. The ICAPS 2018 program chairs will have a look at these
                    papers and the workshop reviews and invite the authors of these papers
                    to resubmit them to the ICAPS 2018 main track.
                    </p>
