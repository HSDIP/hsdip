Feedback/Suggestions we collected in 2021:

* coordinate break with other workshops (in a way that invited talks of other
  workshops can be attended)
* Ask for encodings that mess up heuristics (e.g., state cloning), open
  challenges track, has to be a problem that you want solved
* share talks overlapping two workshops (coordinate schedule)
* better chat (discord?) but beware of adding too many systems
* make chat persistent in some form but make people aware that they are on the
  record at the start.
* advertise more to other communities (idea from SoCS: have a theme, like "route
  planning" and advertise in that area)
