\section*{}
Planning as heuristic search remains among the dominating approaches to many
variations of domain-independent planning, including classical planning,
temporal planning, planning under uncertainty and adversarial planning, for
nearly two decades. The research on both heuristics and search techniqes is
thriving, now more than ever, as evidenced by both the quality and the quantity
of submissions on the topic to major AI conferences and workshops. This
workshop offers a discussion forum and a unique  opportunity to showcase new
and emerging ideas to leading researchers in the area. Past workshops have
featured novel methods that have grown and formed indispensable lines of
research.

This year marks an important landmark, being the tenth workshop since the first
workshop on Heuristics for Domain-independent Planning (HDIP), which was held in
2007.
HDIP was subsequently held in 2009 and 2011. With the fourth workshop in 2012,
the organizers sought to recognize the role of search algorithms by
acknowledging search in the name of the workshop, renaming it to the workshop
on Heuristics and Search for Domain-independent Planning (HSDIP). The workshop
continued flourishing under the new name and has become an annual event at
ICAPS. 


This workshop seeks to understand the underlying principles of current
heuristics and search methods, their limitations, ways for overcoming those
limitations, as well as the synergy between heuristics and search. 

%  Above all, the workshop encourages innovative ideas for heuristics and
% search both in theory and practice. We emphasize clarity and
% understanding rather than focusing solely on significant empirical
% improvements. Rather than worrying exclusively about the number of
% problems solved, or solving larger instances, we have equal interest in
% specific studies on solving complex planning constraints that have
% caused significant difficulty for other planners. Further, though the
% series of workshops have often focused on classical planning, we have
% sought to encourage papers on temporal planning, hierarchical planning,
% planning under uncertainty and a variety of other topics.
