We propose a continuation of the ICAPS workshop series ``Heuristics
and Search for Domain-independent Planning'' at ICAPS 2020.

\section*{Workshop Description}
Heuristic search is one of the main approaches in domain-independent
planning.  We look for contributions that would help us better
understand the ideas underlying current heuristics, their limitations,
and ways for overcoming them.
%
Since the search algorithm plays an equally important role in the
approach, we also invite contributions on new ideas on search
techniques for domain-independent planning, as well as the synergy
between heuristics and search.

Contributions do not have to show that a new approach ``beats the competition''.
While performance measured in the number of evaluated nodes, time, and solution
quality remains relevant, in this workshop we seek above all crisp and
meaningful ideas and understanding.
%
We are interested in all variations of domain-independent planning
such as classical planning, temporal planning, hybrid planning, planning under
uncertainty, adversarial planning or (model-based) reinforcement learning.

\section*{Diversity}
The HSDIP workshop has always been welcoming of multidisciplinary work,
for example, drawing inspiration from operations research (like row and
column generation algorithms), convex optimization (like gradient
optimization for hybrid planning), constraint programming or
satisfiability, or applications of machine learning in heuristic search
(e.g., learning heuristics, or heuristic selection). We will keep this
stance and promote it in the Call for Participation, particularly as ICAPS 2020
will continue the special track on planning \& learning.

\section*{Relevance to ICAPS 2020}

The workshop on heuristics and search for domain-independent planning (HSDIP) is
the successor of the workshop on heuristics for domain-independent planning
(HDIP), a biennial event that took place in conjunction with ICAPS during the
years 2007, 2009, and 2011. Starting with the HSDIP workshop in 2012, the
workshop series became an annual event.
Many ideas presented at HDIP and HSDIP workshops have led to contributions at
major conferences and pushed the frontier of research on heuristic planning in
several directions, both theoretically and practically.
Throughout the years, HSDIP has consistently had a large number of
high-quality submissions and a large workshop participation, including 2019,
which justifies its continuation as an annual event.

\section*{Workshop Format}

The workshop is planned to have a full 1-day format, but the precise
format is to be decided as a function of the contributions received.
We aim to allow all workshop contributors to present orally, and will
adapt the presentation timing to suit. In addition, we plan to include
1-2 dedicated discussion sessions where the audience members are
encouraged to participate.

Following the success of the workshop for the past years and the fact
that the majority of workshop submissions are accepted, we would like to reduce
the reviewing load of the community by not having a program
committee. Acceptance decisions will be made directly by the
organizers. We expect to have around 10-20 submissions, which can
easily be handled by us, particularly considering that reviewing for
workshops is generally light. Between us, we have sufficient
competence in the topic of the workshop to make informed decisions,
but should the need arise, we can call on additional reviewing
expertise.
