\title{ICAPS 2025 Workshop on Heuristics and Search for Domain-independent
Planning (HSDIP)%\\ \vspace*{0.7cm} Workshop Proposal
}
\date{}

\maketitle

\vspace{-2cm}


We propose a continuation of the ICAPS workshop series ``Heuristics
and Search for Domain-independent Planning'' at ICAPS 2025.

\section*{Workshop Description}
Heuristic search is one of the main approaches in domain-independent
planning.  We look for contributions that help us better
understand the ideas underlying current heuristics, their limitations,
and ways for overcoming them.
%
Since the search algorithm plays an equally important role in the
approach, we also invite contributions on new ideas on search
techniques for domain-independent planning, as well as the synergy
between heuristics and search.

Contributions do not have to show that a new approach ``beats the competition''.
While performance measured in the number of evaluated nodes, time, and solution
quality remains relevant, in this workshop we seek above all crisp and
meaningful ideas and understanding.
%
We are interested in all variations of domain-independent planning
such as classical planning, temporal planning, hybrid planning, planning under
uncertainty, adversarial planning, or (model-based) reinforcement learning.

The HSDIP workshop has always been welcoming of multidisciplinary work,
for example, drawing inspiration from operations research (like row and
column generation algorithms), convex optimization (like gradient
optimization for hybrid planning), constraint programming or
satisfiability, or applications of machine learning in heuristic search
(e.g., learning heuristics, or heuristic selection). We will keep this
stance and promote it in the Call for Participation.

\section*{Diversity}
The HSDIP organizing committee is pursuing several strategies to promote
diversity in the HSDIP community. So far, these include,

\begin{itemize}
  \item Inviting a diverse range of potential organizers for the workshop,
  both in terms of under-represented groups as well as academic progression.
  \item Committing to a diverse panel of speakers or invited talks (depending
  on the final chosen format).
  \item (if accessible) Actively promoting the workshop to interested undergraduate
  students specializing in AI, to better promote the field to a wider audience.
\end{itemize}

This list is by no means complete, and we will continue to innovate on what
we can do as an individual workshop to promote diversity both within the scope
of HSDIP, and ICAPS more broadly.

% The HSDIP workshop has always been and strives to continue being an inclusive environment.
% While a large portion of authors is still male and either European or North American/Australian,
% in the past we have seen a number of submissions from other, underrepresented regions,
% such as South America or Asia, or by non-male authors. We will continue encouraging
% diversity among submission authors.

% We feel that promoting diversity just by explicitly mentioning that we
% put an emphasis on underrepresented groups is not sufficient. We
% want to emphasize that a career choice as a computer scientist is a strong choice,
% regardless of gender and nationality. For that we plan to have an invited talk
% given by a speaker who represents that diversity and successful careers can go
% hand in hand.




\section*{Relevance to ICAPS 2025}

The workshop on heuristics and search for domain-independent planning (HSDIP) is
the successor of the workshop on heuristics for domain-independent planning
(HDIP), a biennial event that took place in conjunction with ICAPS during the
years 2007, 2009, and 2011. Starting with the HSDIP workshop in 2012, the
workshop series became an annual event.
Many ideas presented at HDIP and HSDIP workshops have led to contributions at major
conferences and pushed the frontier of research on heuristic planning in several
directions, both theoretically and practically. Throughout the years, HSDIP has
consistently had a large number of high-quality submissions and a large workshop
participation, including the virtual workshop from 2020 to 2022, which justifies its
continuation as an annual event.

\section*{Workshop Format}

The workshop is planned to have a full 1-day format.  We aim to allow all
workshop contributors to present orally as well as in a poster session,
and will adapt the number of full-length and spotlight presentations to suit.
% In addition to the contributed presentations and the poster session,
% we consider including an invited talk or a panel
% discussion session where the audience members are encouraged to participate.
This proposed format is subject to change based on the number of contributions 
received.

We plan to organize the workshop in a small team to reduce the overhead. For
reviewing, we will take a major part of the involved effort. In order to handle
the workload and complement our expertise, we will invite 5-10 external
reviewers. These will be recruited mainly from past workshop organizers who are
familiar with the process for HSDIP. We expect to have around 10-20 submissions, which can
easily be handled in that way, particularly considering that reviewing for
workshops is generally lightweight.
