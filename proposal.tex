\title{ICAPS 2017 Workshop on \\ Heuristics and Search for Domain-independent
Planning (HSDIP)\\ \vspace*{0.7cm} Workshop Proposal
}

\maketitle


We propose a continuation of the ICAPS workshop series ``Heuristics
(and Search) for Domain-independent Planning'' at ICAPS 2017.

\section*{Workshop Description}
Heuristic search is one of the main approaches in domain-independent
planning.  We look for contributions that would help us better
understand the ideas underlying current heuristics, their limitations,
and ways for overcoming them.

Since the search algorithm plays an equally important role in the
approach, we also invite contributions on new ideas on search
techniques for domain-independent planning, as well as the synergy
between heuristics and search.

Contributions do not have to show that a new approach ``beats the competition''.
While performance measured in the number of evaluated nodes, time, and solution
quality remains relevant, in this workshop we seek above all crisp and
meaningful ideas and understanding.

We are interested in all variations of domain-independent planning
such as classical planning, temporal planning, hybrid planning, planning under
uncertainty and adversarial planning.

\section*{Relevance to ICAPS 2017}

The workshop on heuristics and search for domain-independent planning
(HSDIP) is the successor of the workshop on heuristics for
domain-independent planning (HDIP), a biennial event that took place
in conjunction with ICAPS during the years 2007, 2009, and 2011. The
HDIP workshop was a very successful event every time. Many ideas
presented at HDIP workshops have led to contributions at major
conferences and pushed the frontier of research on heuristic planning
in several directions, both theoretically and practically.
%
With the HSDIP workshops in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, the workshop
series became an annual event. The fact that last year's HSDIP again had very
high quality contributions and that it was one of the largest workshops held
shows a sufficient amount of interest in the ICAPS community, justifying its
continuation as annual event.

\section*{Workshop Format}

The workshop is planned to be a full 1-day format, but the precise
format is to be decided as a function of the contributions received.
We strive to have two types of presentations: long and short (30 and
15 minutes, including discussion), as well as 1-2 dedicated discussion
sessions where the audience members are encouraged to participate.

Following the success of the workshop in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, and the fact that
the majority of workshop submissions are accepted, we would like to reduce
the reviewing load of the community by not having a program
committee. Acceptance decisions will be made directly by the
organizers. We expect to have around 10-20 submissions, which can
easily be handled by us, particularly considering that reviewing for
workshops is generally light. Between us, we have sufficient
competence in the topic of the workshop to make informed decisions,
but should the need arise, we can call on additional reviewing
expertise.
